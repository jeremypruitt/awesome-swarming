One significant challenge is that ubiquitous multi-tiered structure of support team organisation, which, this presentation argues, is fundamentally incompatible with the DevOps philosophy. We propose its replacement with Swarming, a methodology that harnesses and enables the benefits of DevOps, while doing so on an Enterprise support scale.*"
