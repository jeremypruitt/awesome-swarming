  > "*Sometimes called collaboration on steroids, the Intelligent Swarming methodology is a new way to align resources to work. It involves removing the tiers of support and, when appropriate, calling on the collective expertise of a “swarm” of analysts.  Our initial experience with Intelligent Swarming is exceeding expectations in terms of improvement in operational efficiencies, employee engagement, and customer satisfaction and loyalty, and it brings with it a host of questions around practices and measurements.*" - Excerpt

  > "*Traditional support is structured in tiers—typically Levels 1, 2, and 3. In this model, users contact the service desk, Level 1, where agents are skilled to handle routine issues, but not much more. To reach in-depth expertise, you have to wait for Levels 2 and 3, but you have to go through Level 1 first. The new SaaS model makes the most experienced and skilled agents the first point of contact for end users by leveraging three key elements:*

  > "*As enterprises transform around software-led innovation, DevOps teams start to need to deal with customer support at scale, while IT Service Management needs to adapt to a new, fast-moving reality of increased developer autonomy and collaboration. One significant challenge is that ubiquitous multi-tiered structure of support team organisation, which, this presentation argues, is fundamentally incompatible with the DevOps philosophy. We propose its replacement with Swarming, a methodology that harnesses and enables the benefits of DevOps, while doing so on an Enterprise support scale.*"
