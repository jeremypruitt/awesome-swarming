We will discuss the ongoing emergence of Swarming as an alternative to 3-tier support structures, showing the latest examples from a diverse range of industries including software, telecommunications, and automotive.*"

  > "*The presentation will show how Swarming enables smarter interaction between DevOps teams and established ITSM functions, and will show – using the Cynefin framework as an example - how Swarming enables provision of adaptive support for complex distributed systems in a way that tiered support can’t.*"

This means that the support person will seek the proper resource, working towards a resolution instead of escalating it to a higher level. This is potentially aggravating to customers who have become used to speedy resolutions. By not escalating, the person working towards the resolution “swarms” with other peers around a problem until that issue is resolved.*"
