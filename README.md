Introduction
------------

  > "*Sometimes called collaboration on steroids, the Intelligent Swarming methodology is a new way to align resources to work. It involves removing the tiers of support and, when appropriate, calling on the collective expertise of a “swarm” of analysts.  Our initial experience with Intelligent Swarming is exceeding expectations in terms of improvement in operational efficiencies, employee engagement, and customer satisfaction and loyalty, and it brings with it a host of questions around practices and measurements.*" - Excerpt

  > "*Intelligent swarming is a dramatically different way to organize the support organization, challenging thirty years of accepted practice and structure in support. However, the early adopters of this model are seeing improvements in all key operational measures of support, including productivity, time to resolve, employee growth, and customer satisfaction. And while it is not appropriate for all support environments, swarming is most effective when solving new, complex problems. The goal is to get the right people working on new issues, together, and as quickly as possible. Intelligent swarming facilitates the collaboration already happening between support agents and leads to faster and more creative resolutions.*"
  >
  > "*Let’s examine what is driving this change, how it works, where it applies, and why it can be a more efficient and effective way to deliver support.*"

  > "*Intelligent swarming entails restructuring the support organization by doing away with support tiers and replacing escalations and inefficient hand-offs with collaboration. The goal is to get the person who’s most likely to be able to solve an issue working on it at the first touch, whether that person’s a specialist or a generalist. A generalist may even collaborate with a specialist to resolve an issue.*"
  >
  > "*Early adopters of the intelligent swarming model have seen dramatic improvements in skills development, employee morale, and operational efficiency. Most importantly, their customers love it! These organizations have also found that not all incidents require collaboration between multiple support professionals; only 20–35 percent of the incidents closed in these environments require collaboration.*"

  > "*Customers typically need answers fast. They do not want to explain the problem all over again and they do not want steps that have already been tried unsuccessfully before to be tried again. The solution is to ensure that such problems are solved by collaboration instead of escalation. By working closely with other experts and ensuring updates are shared with the customer by the expert and in the presence of the other team members, firstly, the problem gets solved quickly. Secondly, the other team members gain knowledge, which they can then utilize the next time a similar problem occurs.*"

This is potentially aggravating to customers who have become used to speedy resolutions. By not escalating, the person working towards the resolution “swarms” with other peers around a problem until that issue is resolved.*"
