  > "*Sometimes called collaboration on steroids, the Intelligent Swarming methodology is a new way to align resources to work. It involves removing the tiers of support and, when appropriate, calling on the collective expertise of a “swarm” of analysts.  Our initial experience with Intelligent Swarming is exceeding expectations in terms of improvement in operational efficiencies, employee engagement, and customer satisfaction and loyalty, and it brings with it a host of questions around practices and measurements.*" - Excerpt

  > "*Intelligent swarming is a dramatically different way to organize the support organization, challenging thirty years of accepted practice and structure in support. However, the early adopters of this model are seeing improvements in all key operational measures of support, including productivity, time to resolve, employee growth, and customer satisfaction. And while it is not appropriate for all support environments, swarming is most effective when solving new, complex problems. The goal is to get the right people working on new issues, together, and as quickly as possible. Intelligent swarming facilitates the collaboration already happening between support agents and leads to faster and more creative resolutions.*"
  >
  > "*Let’s examine what is driving this change, how it works, where it applies, and why it can be a more efficient and effective way to deliver support.*"

Swarming would require needed talent and skills to flow quickly toward projects, as it capitalizes upon an agile culture and a fluid talent stream. This requires a modern view of organizational boundaries and talent utilization. There are challenges to swarming — and the process may not prove appropriate for all organizations. However, it may be an interesting option to consider.*"

A generalist may even collaborate with a specialist to resolve an issue.*"

  > "*Early adopters of the intelligent swarming model have seen dramatic improvements in skills development, employee morale, and operational efficiency. Most importantly, their customers love it! These organizations have also found that not all incidents require collaboration between multiple support professionals; only 20–35 percent of the incidents closed in these environments require collaboration.*"

The case owner owns the case to resolution (a practice sometimes called “touch and hold.”) If the case owner needs help, he or she can request it. Or, if someone else thinks they have the right skills to help, they volunteer to help. Laid out that way, it’s a pretty simple idea, but one with profound implications.*"

The solution is to ensure that such problems are solved by collaboration instead of escalation. By working closely with other experts and ensuring updates are shared with the customer by the expert and in the presence of the other team members, firstly, the problem gets solved quickly. Secondly, the other team members gain knowledge, which they can then utilize the next time a similar problem occurs.*"

We will discuss the ongoing emergence of Swarming as an alternative to 3-tier support structures, showing the latest examples from a diverse range of industries including software, telecommunications, and automotive.*"

  > "*The presentation will show how Swarming enables smarter interaction between DevOps teams and established ITSM functions, and will show – using the Cynefin framework as an example - how Swarming enables provision of adaptive support for complex distributed systems in a way that tiered support can’t.*"

  > "*Intelligent swarming is the idea that one support person will work on a trouble ticket from start to finish, without escalations. This means that the support person will seek the proper resource, working towards a resolution instead of escalating it to a higher level. This is potentially aggravating to customers who have become used to speedy resolutions. By not escalating, the person working towards the resolution “swarms” with other peers around a problem until that issue is resolved.*"

In this model, users contact the service desk, Level 1, where agents are skilled to handle routine issues, but not much more. To reach in-depth expertise, you have to wait for Levels 2 and 3, but you have to go through Level 1 first. The new SaaS model makes the most experienced and skilled agents the first point of contact for end users by leveraging three key elements:*
